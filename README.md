# AQCM_algorithm_MATLAB
Matlab implementation of the AQCM algorithm for hierarchical clustering

To use the software in this package it is necessary to begin with the example script "aqcm_use_basic.m"

The comments in that example are verbose in order to clarify input/output object structures and the use of visualization tools.
Comments in other example scripts are less verbose as it is assumed the user has studied the basic use example.
